# hw1_p1
This is a repository for my EC500A3 assignment at BU. This particular assignment is the second part of HW1 (i.e, HW1 P1).


TO DO  
[ ] Write a function to constantly update arrays or objects that track all user rankings

[ ] Write function to get all the current information from Redis of a student's rankings (this method will be called whenever a student edits their submissions)

[ ] Write a function to "submit" all values to Redis (this will be called when a user is done editing their rankings OR called whenever a change to the ranking values is done)

[ ] Figure out how to return a value from an async array!


Get number of elements in a class:
* `document.GgetElementsByClassName('classstringhere').length;`

QUESTIONS
* Will we allow users to enter student names that have "spaces" in them?
